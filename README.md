<h1>
  Project for handling big numbers
</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  Numbers that are larger than <b> 1e18 </b> can't be handled with accuracy and operations can't be performed on them.
  <br>
  So this program solves the problem of handling large numbers which can be used in numerous other projects such as
  <ul>
    <li>RSA algorithms and other cryptographic algorithms where large numbers are multiplied</li>
    <li>Factorial of large numbers (ex- 1000!) </li>
    <li>Hashing blockchain addresses</li>
    <li>Quantum computing and Shor's Algorithm</li>
  </ul>
</p>
